# DMA driver

## Project description: 
* You are required to develop a complete software driver for the DMA peripheral in the STM32F401 MCU.

## Project requirements:
Your driver should provide the following APIs

* A function to initialize the DMA driver.
* A function to initialize the DMA channel parameters, DMA Peripheral ID, Trigger source, Source address, destination address, number of transfers, transfer item size, transfer mode, transfer type(Single or burst).
* A function to request from the driver to start software transfer (memory to memory).
* A function to check the transfer state.


You have to configure the DMA interrupt and in the DMA ISR you have to call an notification function for the DMA client.</br></br>

Your test code should be a dummy client that create two arrays of integers of size 100 elements. One of them is already initialized with numbers of 100,200, â€¦ till the end. This will be the source array.</br>

The second one is the destination array with the same type and size and will be initialized by all zeros.</br>

Your DMA driver shall be used to copy the source array into the destination array.</br>
